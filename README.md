As of September 2024 this is a work in progress.

The intention is for this repo to show examples of minimal apps on various platforms
that show how to add support for Bristlemouth in that environment.
The first example we'll build aligns with the current Bristlemouth mote,
which has an STM32U575 and uses FreeRTOS.
